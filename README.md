## üìå Features

### üå¶ Weather Forecasting
- Provides daily and 6-day weather forecasts.
- Helps farmers plan their agricultural activities efficiently based on predicted weather conditions.

### üå± Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation
- Uses key soil parameters such as:
  - **NPK Levels** (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
  - **pH Levels**
  - **Rainfall Data**
  - **Soil Moisture**
- Suggests the best crops to grow and the most suitable fertilizers to improve yield.

### ü¶† Plant Disease & Pest Classification
- **Online Mode:** Uses real-time AI models for disease and pest classification.
- **Offline Mode:** Works with a locally stored model, enabling classification even in low-connectivity areas.
- The model has been trained on a **diverse dataset covering 55 plant diseases and pest types**.

### üåç Local Language Support
- Ensures ease of use by integrating multiple language options for farmers in different regions.
